        <b>Rooftop Cinema</b>
        <p>
          Seven flights of stairs, and an additional staircase at the top, may induce just a hint of trepidation in a first-time visitor. A concrete rooftop bar covered in astro turf, deck chairs, and big umbrellas, Rooftop has an amazing awe factor.
          We helped the owners behind Rooftop Cinema get the word out for  the Summer  Cinema experience with expertise, and great retro themed prints on uncoated paper.

          With as many as 6 new shows launching every quarter, keeping audiences tuned in and aware
